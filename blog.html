        <h1>This is the best restaurant that never existed</h1>
        <p>I went yesterday here and tried some of their finest dishes and was pleasantly surprised by the quality.</p>
        <p>On top of that, it wasn't even that expensive.</p>
        <p>The waiters were also really nice and the food was served quite fast</p>
        <p>I rate it 10/10 and would recommend it to anyone that finds themselves in the area.</p>

        <h1>This is the worst restaurant that never existed</h1>
        <p>I went yesterday here and tried some of their finest dishes and was served the wrong order.</p>
        <p>On top of that, when I told the waiter that it wasn't my order, they argued that I didn't know what I ordered and that they did nothing wrong.</p>
        <p>I even showed them the receipt and they tried to tell me that they brought the right order. In the end I had to eat someone else's food which, after looking through the menu, I found out it was cheaper than what I ordered.</p>
        <p>I rate it 0/10 and would not recommend it to anyone.</p>
